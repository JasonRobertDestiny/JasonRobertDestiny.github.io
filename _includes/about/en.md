# Past Projects Portfolio

## **Featured Projects**

### **🎯 MeetSpot - Programming Marathon "Best Application Award"**

**Project Overview:** A lightweight intelligent meeting point recommendation web application designed to efficiently solve the problem of multi-person gathering venue selection. Users simply input multiple participants' locations, and the system calculates the geometric center point through innovative algorithms and intelligently recommends the most suitable gathering places nearby.

**Core Contributions & Technical Highlights:**
- **Led Core Algorithm:** As the core developer, I led the design and implementation of the recommendation algorithm, effectively improving path planning rationality and location matching accuracy by integrating multi-source geographic information with user profiles
- **High-Performance Backend:** Built on **FastAPI** with **aiohttp** for asynchronous requests to Amap API, ensuring high performance and fast response of backend services
- **Native Frontend Development:** Frontend built with native **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** without framework dependencies, achieving a clean, lightweight, and responsive user interface with seamless integration of one-click map navigation

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, aiohttp, Vanilla JS, HTML5/CSS3, Amap API
