## üèÜ The Night I Won Two Awards (And Almost Quit Two Months Earlier)

It was 11:47 PM on September 15th, 2024, when the Alipay Mini-Program team announced the winners. I was sitting in my dorm room, half-expecting nothing‚Äîmy NeighborHelp app had crashed during the final demo presentation three hours earlier. The database connection pooling issue I'd been fighting for two weeks decided to show up at the worst possible moment.

Then my phone exploded with notifications. **"Congratulations! NeighborHelp wins Best Application Award in Alipay Baobao Box Innovation Challenge!"**

Two months earlier, on July 23rd at 2:34 AM, I'd seriously considered abandoning both projects. MeetSpot had 47 users after three months of work, and 22 of them were classmates I'd personally begged to try it. NeighborHelp didn't exist yet‚Äîjust a half-written pitch deck and a database schema that made no sense when I reviewed it the next morning.

But here's what nobody tells you about building AI applications: **The gap between "demo that impresses your friends" and "production app serving strangers" is about 300 hours of debugging, $847 in API costs you didn't budget for, and at least one complete architecture rewrite.**

This is the real story of how I built two award-winning AI agent applications. Not the sanitized conference talk version‚Äîthe messy, expensive, occasionally triumphant reality of shipping AI to production in 2024.

> "The best way to learn AI development isn't through courses‚Äîit's by building something real people will actually use, breaking it in production, and fixing it at 3 AM." - Lesson learned after 2,400+ hours

## üìä The Numbers Don't Lie (But They Don't Tell the Whole Story)

Before I dive into the narrative, here's the raw data from both projects:

| Project | Award | Tech Stack | Dev Time | Users | Rating | Revenue |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **MeetSpot** | üèÜ Programming Marathon Best App Award | Vue.js + Node.js + GPT-4 API + MySQL | 3 months (720 hours) | 500+ | 4.8/5.0 | $0 (portfolio project) |
| **NeighborHelp** | ü•á Alipay Baobao Box Best App Award | React + Python + FastAPI + MongoDB | 4 months (860 hours) | 340+ active | 4.6/5.0 | $0 (awarded $5,000 grant) |

**Combined Project Metrics**:
- üí∞ **Total API Costs**: $847 (GPT-4: $623, Maps: $224)
- üìä **Total Users**: 840+
- üî• **Problems Solved**: 1,247 real user requests processed
- ‚≠ê **Average Rating**: 4.7/5.0
- üöÄ **Daily Active Users**: 65% (higher than I expected)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Major Production Bugs**: 7 (all caught by real users, not QA)
- üåô **Late Night Emergency Fixes**: 12
- ‚òï **Coffee Consumed**: Immeasurable

**What The Numbers Don't Show**:
- 23 complete rewrites of core algorithms
- $200 burned on bad API prompt engineering before I learned proper techniques
- 8 times I wanted to quit
- 1 girlfriend who tolerated me disappearing into code for weeks
- The 4.2 seconds of pure joy when the first stranger gave 5 stars

## üéØ Why I Built AI Agents (And Why You Might Want To)

**The Honest Answer**: I didn't choose AI agent development because I'm some visionary who saw the future. I chose it because I was bored during summer break 2023, GPT-3.5 had just become accessible, and I thought "how hard could it be to build a smart meeting scheduler?"

Turns out: very hard. But also incredibly rewarding.

Let me break down my actual decision-making process using the framework I developed after making this choice:

```python
# My Real Technology Choice Decision Model (Created AFTER Choosing AI Agents)
class TechDecisionMaker:
    """
    This is how I SHOULD have evaluated the decision.
    I actually just jumped in and figured it out later.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.criteria = {
            "market_opportunity": 0.30,    # Is there a real market?
            "technical_challenge": 0.25,    # Will I learn valuable skills?
            "learning_resources": 0.20,     # Can I actually learn this?
            "practical_value": 0.15,        # Does it solve real problems?
            "innovation_potential": 0.10    # Can I build something unique?
        }

    def evaluate_ai_agent_development(self):
        # Scores based on my ACTUAL experience (not predictions)
        actual_scores = {
            "market_opportunity": 9.5,  # Exploding market (I was right about this)
            "technical_challenge": 8.5,  # Hard but learnable (underestimated difficulty)
            "learning_resources": 7.0,   # Sparse docs, lots of trial and error
            "practical_value": 8.0,      # Real users = real validation
            "innovation_potential": 9.0  # Huge room for creativity
        }

        total_score = sum(actual_scores[k] * self.criteria[k] for k in actual_scores)
        return total_score  # Result: 8.55/10

        # Reality check: Would I do it again?
        # YES, but with better planning and a bigger API budget.
```

**What I Wish I'd Known Before Starting**:

1. **AI APIs Are Expensive**: My first month's GPT-4 bill was $287. I'd budgeted $50. The difference came out of my food budget. I ate a lot of instant noodles in August 2024.

2. **"Intelligent" Doesn't Mean "Always Correct"**: MeetSpot's first version recommended a luxury hotel lobby for a student study group because the AI thought "quiet meeting space" = expensive. Learned a lot about prompt engineering that week.

3. **User Trust Is Everything**: When NeighborHelp's recommendation engine suggested the wrong helper for an elderly user's request, I got an angry phone call from her daughter. That's when I added the human review layer for sensitive requests.

4. **You'll Need More Skills Than You Think**: I thought I just needed to know React and call an API. Actually needed: backend architecture, database design, caching strategies, API rate limiting, error handling, user auth, payment integration (for premium features I never launched), mobile responsiveness, SEO, analytics setup, and customer support workflows.

## üöÄ Project Deep Dive: MeetSpot - The Meeting Point Optimizer

### The Problem I Discovered By Accident

I didn't sit down and think "what problem should I solve?" The problem found me.

It was May 12th, 2024. My study group had spent 47 minutes in a WeChat group chat trying to decide where five of us should meet for a project discussion. Everyone kept suggesting places near their own locations. Someone wanted Starbucks. Someone else was vegetarian and needed food options. Another person didn't want to spend money.

I remember thinking: *"This is stupid. A computer should be able to solve this in 10 seconds."*

That thought led to 720 hours of work.

**The Real User Pain Points** (discovered through 23 user interviews I conducted at campus coffee shops):

1. **Decision Fatigue**: Groups spend 30-60 minutes on average deciding meeting locations
2. **Bias Toward Convenient (For Some)**: Usually one person picks a place near them, others just agree to avoid conflict
3. **Missing Important Factors**: People forget to consider parking, noise levels, WiFi quality, outlet availability
4. **Information Overload**: Too many options, not enough structured comparison

### Architecture Evolution: From Naive to Actually Working

**Version 1: The "I Thought This Would Be Easy" Architecture** (June 2024)

```javascript
// My first attempt - laughably simple
async function findMeetingSpot(userLocations) {
    // Step 1: Calculate center point (I used simple arithmetic average - WRONG)
    const center = calculateAverage(userLocations);

    // Step 2: Search nearby places (no filtering - WRONG)
    const places = await mapsAPI.searchNearby(center, radius=5000);

    // Step 3: Return first result (spectacularly WRONG)
    return places[0];
}

// What could go wrong? (Narrator: Everything went wrong)
```

**Problems with V1**:
- Simple average doesn't account for Earth's curvature (caused 200m errors)
- No consideration of transportation modes
- Returned a funeral home once (true story, user was not amused)
- Didn't consider user preferences AT ALL
- Response time: 8.3 seconds (users left before seeing results)

**Version 2: The "I Learned About Geographic Calculations" Architecture** (July 2024)

This is when I discovered the Haversine formula and spherical trigonometry. My high school math teacher would be proud.

```javascript
// MeetSpot V2 - Geographic Center Point Calculation
class LocationOptimizer {
    constructor() {
        this.EARTH_RADIUS = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers
    }

    calculateGeographicCenter(locations) {
        // Convert to Cartesian coordinates to handle Earth's curvature
        let x = 0, y = 0, z = 0;

        locations.forEach(loc => {
            const latRad = this.toRadians(loc.lat);
            const lngRad = this.toRadians(loc.lng);

            // Transform to 3D Cartesian space
            x += Math.cos(latRad) * Math.cos(lngRad);
            y += Math.cos(latRad) * Math.sin(lngRad);
            z += Math.sin(latRad);
        });

        // Calculate averages
        const total = locations.length;
        x /= total;
        y /= total;
        z /= total;

        // Convert back to geographic coordinates
        const lngCenter = Math.atan2(y, x);
        const hyp = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y);
        const latCenter = Math.atan2(z, hyp);

        return {
            lat: this.toDegrees(latCenter),
            lng: this.toDegrees(lngCenter)
        };
    }

    // Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
    calculateDistance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2) {
        const dLat = this.toRadians(lat2 - lat1);
        const dLng = this.toRadians(lng2 - lng1);

        const a = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
                Math.cos(this.toRadians(lat1)) *
                Math.cos(this.toRadians(lat2)) *
                Math.sin(dLng/2) * Math.sin(dLng/2);

        const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
        return this.EARTH_RADIUS * c; // Distance in km
    }

    toRadians(degrees) { return degrees * (Math.PI / 180); }
    toDegrees(radians) { return radians * (180 / Math.PI); }
}
```

**V2 Improvements**:
- Accurate geographic calculations (no more 200m errors!)
- Considered Earth's curvature
- Better distance calculations
- Response time: 3.2 seconds (better, but still slow)

**V2 Problems**:
- Still didn't consider user preferences
- No scoring system for venues
- Slow API calls (not cached)
- Recommended expensive places for broke students

**Version 3: The "Production-Ready" Architecture** (August 2024 - Current)

This is the version that won the award. Took me 6 complete rewrites to get here.

```javascript
// MeetSpot V3 - Multi-Dimensional Venue Scoring System
class VenueScorer {
    constructor() {
        // Weights determined through A/B testing with 87 users
        this.weights = {
            distanceScore: 0.35,     // Most important: convenience
            ratingScore: 0.25,       // Quality matters
            priceScore: 0.15,        // Budget constraints
            categoryMatch: 0.15,     // Meeting type appropriateness
            trafficScore: 0.10       // Transportation accessibility
        };

        // Cache for performance (reduced API calls by 73%)
        this.cache = new Map();
    }

    async calculateComprehensiveScore(venue, userPreferences, userLocations) {
        const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(venue.id, userPreferences);

        // Check cache first (avg response time dropped from 3.2s to 0.8s)
        if (this.cache.has(cacheKey)) {
            return this.cache.get(cacheKey);
        }

        const scores = {};

        // 1. Distance Score: Favor venues minimizing MAX individual distance
        // (This was key insight: don't just minimize average, minimize worst-case)
        const distances = userLocations.map(loc =>
            this.calculateDistance(venue.location, loc)
        );
        const maxDistance = Math.max(...distances);
        const avgDistance = distances.reduce((a,b) => a+b) / distances.length;

        // Penalize high max distance more heavily (fairness principle)
        scores.distanceScore = Math.max(0, 1 - (maxDistance * 0.5 + avgDistance * 0.5) / 10);

        // 2. User Rating Score (normalized from review platforms)
        scores.ratingScore = Math.min(venue.rating / 5.0, 1.0);

        // 3. Price Score: Match user budget expectations

        );

        // 5. Traffic Accessibility: Public transport + parking
        scores.trafficScore = await this.calculateTrafficScore(venue);

        // Weighted final score
        const finalScore = Object.keys(scores).reduce((total, key) => {

        }

    }
}
```

### What I Learned From 500+ Real Users

**Unexpected User Behaviors**:

1. **People Don't Trust Pure AI Recommendations**: Added a "Show me why" button that displays the scoring breakdown. Adoption increased 34% after this single feature.

2. **Mobile-First Is Not Optional**: 82% of users accessed MeetSpot on phones while already in transit. Desktop optimization was wasted effort.

3. **Speed Trumps Accuracy (To a Point)**: Users preferred "good enough" results in 1 second over "perfect" results in 5 seconds. I added progressive loading‚Äîshow cached results immediately, refine in background.

4. **Students Are Broke**: Had to add "Free WiFi Required" and "Under $5 per person" filters. These became the most-used features.

**Production Metrics That Matter**:
- ‚ö° **Average Response Time**: 0.9 seconds (down from 8.3s in V1)
- üéØ **Recommendation Acceptance Rate**: 78% (users actually went to suggested places)
- üìä **User Retention**: 67% came back for second use (industry average: 25%)
- üí∞ **API Cost Per Request**: $0.08 (optimized from $0.34)
- üêõ **Critical Bugs in Production**: 3 (caught by users, not QA‚ÄîI didn't have QA)

## üèòÔ∏è Project Deep Dive: NeighborHelp - The Community AI Assistant

### How A Personal Frustration Became An Award Winner

July 2024. My apartment's water heater broke. I needed someone to help me move it out (two-person job), but I'm new to Beijing and didn't know anyone in the building.

Posted in the community WeChat group: *"Anyone free to help move a water heater? Will buy you dinner."*

Got 7 responses. Three wanted money upfront. Two never showed up. One guy helped but then asked me to help him move furniture the next day (fair, but I had exams).

I remember thinking: *"There should be a better system for this. Like Uber, but for neighbor favors."*

That thought became NeighborHelp.

### The Architecture: Building Trust Into Code

The core challenge wasn't technical‚Äîit was social. How do you build a system where strangers trust each other enough to ask for (and offer) help?

**Core Innovation: Dynamic Trust Scoring**

```python
# NeighborHelp Trust Assessment System
class TrustScorer:
    """
    Trust is the currency of community platforms.
    This took 47 iterations to get right.
    """
    def __init__(self):

        self.decay_rate = 0.95  # Old actions matter less over time

    def calculate_trust_score(self, user_id):
        user_history = self.get_user_history(user_id)

        if not user_history:
            return self.base_trust

            'response_time': 0.15,       # Are you reliable?
            'peer_ratings': 0.25,        # What do others say?
            'account_age': 0.10,         # Longer history = more trust
            'verification_level': 0.10,  # ID verified?
            'community_contribution': 0.10  # Do you help others?
        }

        trust_score = sum(components[k] * weights[k] for k in components)

        # Apply time decay to old data (recent behavior matters more)
        recency_factor = self.calculate_recency_factor(user_history)
        final_score = trust_score * recency_factor

        return round(final_score, 3)

    def calculate_completion_rate(self, history):
        """
        Percentage of commitments actually fulfilled.
        Harsh penalty for ghosting.
        """
        total_commitments = len(history['commitments'])
        if total_commitments == 0:
            return self.base_trust

        completed = sum(1 for c in history['commitments'] if c['status'] == 'completed')
        ghosted = sum(1 for c in history['commitments'] if c['status'] == 'ghosted')

        # Ghosting is heavily penalized (learned after bad user experience)
        completion_rate = (completed - ghosted * 2) / total_commitments
        return max(0, min(1, completion_rate))

    def calculate_response_reliability(self, history):
        """
        How quickly and consistently does user respond?
        Users hate being left hanging.
        """
        response_times = [r['time_to_respond'] for r in history['responses']]

        elif avg_response_minutes <= 120:
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 0.2
```

### The Matching Algorithm: More Than Just Distance

Early versions of NeighborHelp just matched based on proximity. This led to awkward situations‚Äîlike matching a 20-year-old guy to help a 65-year-old woman with grocery shopping. Her family called me. Not pleasant.

**Version 2: Context-Aware Matching**

```python
class SmartMatcher:
    """
    Learned these rules from 340 real neighbor interactions.
    Some through user feedback. Some through angry phone calls.
    """
    def find_best_matches(self, help_request, available_neighbors):
        matches = []

        for neighbor in available_neighbors:
            # Calculate multi-dimensional similarity
            similarity_score = self.calculate_similarity(help_request, neighbor)

            # Safety filters (added after incidents)
            if not self.passes_safety_check(help_request, neighbor):
                continue

            # Threshold learned from feedback: anything below 0.6 = bad matches
            if similarity_score > 0.6:
                matches.append({
                    'neighbor': neighbor,
                    'score': similarity_score,

                })

        # Sort by score, return top 5

        return matches[:5]

    def calculate_similarity(self, request, neighbor):
        """

```

### Real Production Challenges (And Honest Solutions)

**Challenge 1: The Cold Start Problem**

When I launched NeighborHelp in my apartment complex (200 units), I had 3 users the first week. Nobody wants to be first on a platform with no one else.

**Solution**: I became the platform's most active helper for the first month. Signed up my roommates. Offered to help with anything. Built up 47 successful interactions before the network effect kicked in.

**Lesson**: Sometimes the solution to a technical problem is just good old-fashioned hustle.

**Challenge 2: The "No-Show" Problem**

Early version had a 32% no-show rate. People would commit to help, then ghost. This killed trust fast.

**Solution**: Implemented a three-strike system with automated reminders:
- 1 hour before: "Reminder: You're helping with [task] in 1 hour"
- 15 minutes before: "Your neighbor is counting on you!"
- After no-show: "You missed your commitment. This affects your trust score."

No-show rate dropped to 8%. The key insight: people don't mean to flake, they just forget.

**Challenge 3: The Database Crash During Demo**

September 15th, 2024. Final presentation for the Alipay competition. 200 people watching online. I click "Find Helper" to demo the matching algorithm.

Error: "Database connection pool exhausted."

My heart stopped. I'd been testing with 5 concurrent users. The demo had 47 people trying the app simultaneously.

**Emergency Fix** (implemented during the 10-minute Q&A session):
```python
# Before (in production, somehow)
db_pool = create_connection_pool(max_connections=5)  # OOPS

# After (fixed during Q&A while sweating profusely)
db_pool = create_connection_pool(
    max_connections=50,  # Handle traffic spikes
    min_connections=10,   # Always ready
    connection_timeout=30,
    queue_timeout=10
)
```

Somehow, I still won. The judges liked that I fixed it live and explained what went wrong. Honesty beats perfection.

## üí° Core Insights: What I Learned About AI Development

### Insight 1: AI Is Just Math (But Users Think It's Magic)

Users would say things like "The AI knows exactly what I need!" when really, it was just weighted averages and Haversine formulas.

**Key Learning**: Don't break the magic. Users don't need to know it's "just math"‚Äîthe experience is what matters.

But also: Always have a "Show me why" button for transparency. Some users want to peek behind the curtain.

### Insight 2: Prompt Engineering Is 60% Of AI Development

My first GPT-4 prompts for NeighborHelp were terrible:

```
Bad Prompt (July 2024):
"Analyze this help request and find a good match."

Result: Generic, often wrong, cost $0.34 per request
```

After 200+ iterations:

```python
Good Prompt (September 2024):
"""
You are a community platform assistant helping match neighbors for assistance.

Help Request:
- Type: {request_type}
- Urgency: {urgency_level}
- Required Skills: {skills}
- Requester Profile: Age {age}, Trust Score {trust_score}

Available Helper:
- Skills: {helper_skills}
- Availability: {availability}
- Past Successes: {success_count}
- Trust Score: {helper_trust}

Task: Assess match quality (0-100) considering:
1. Skill match (can they help?)
2. Availability match (are they free?)
3. Trust compatibility (safe for requester?)
4. Past performance (reliable?)

Output JSON:
{
  "match_score": <0-100>,
  "confidence": <low|medium|high>,
  "reasoning": "<one sentence explanation>",
  "safety_check": <pass|review|fail>
}
"""

Result: Accurate, explainable, cost $0.08 per request (76% cost reduction)
```

**The Difference**: Specific instructions, structured output, clear criteria.

### Insight 3: Cache Everything (But Invalidate Intelligently)

First month API costs: $287
After implementing smart caching: $84

```javascript
// Cache Strategy That Actually Works
class SmartCache {
    constructor() {
        this.shortTermCache = new Map();  // 1 hour TTL - venue info
        this.mediumTermCache = new Map();  // 24 hour TTL - user profiles
        this.longTermCache = new Map();    // 7 day TTL - static data
    }

    async getCachedOrFetch(key, fetchFn, cacheType = 'short') {
        const cache = this[`${cacheType}TermCache`];

        if (cache.has(key)) {
            const cached = cache.get(key);
            if (!this.isExpired(cached)) {
                return cached.data;  // Cache hit - saved API call
            }
        }

        // Cache miss - fetch fresh data
        const data = await fetchFn();
        cache.set(key, {
            data,
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            ttl: this.getTTL(cacheType)
        });

        return data;
    }
}
```

Reduced API calls by 73%. Same user experience. Way cheaper.

### Insight 4: Users Don't Read Instructions

Built a beautiful onboarding tutorial. 87% of users skipped it.

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure. Show help exactly when it's needed, not before.

```javascript
// Instead of upfront tutorial
showFullTutorial();  // Nobody reads this

// Do contextual hints
if (user.firstTimeUsingFeature('matching')) {
    showTooltip("üí° Tip: We'll show you the top 5 matches based on distance and trust score");
}
```

Feature adoption went from 34% to 79% just by moving the explanation to the moment of use.

- Trust system design
- Performance optimization under constraints
- Database scaling (learned via production failure)

**Non-Technical Skills Gained**:
- User research and feedback loops
- Crisis management (live demo failures)
- Budget management (API costs hurt)
- Public speaking (pitch presentations)
- Saying "no" to feature requests that don't align with core value prop

## üéØ Advice For Aspiring AI Developers

### What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

**1. Start Smaller Than You Think**

Don't try to build "Uber but with AI" as your first project. Build "Find a coffee shop for two people" first. Then "Find a coffee shop for five people." Then add AI recommendations. Then add preferences. Build incrementally.

**2. Budget For API Costs (And Triple It)**

My API budget mistakes:
- Month 1: Budgeted $50, spent $287
- Month 2: Budgeted $150, spent $198 (getting better)
- Month 3: Budgeted $200, spent $84 (caching magic)

Rule of thumb: If you budget $X, you'll spend 3X initially, then optimize down to 0.5X.

**3. Real Users Beat Perfect Code**

I spent 3 weeks building a beautiful recommendation algorithm. Users hated it because it was slow. Rebuilt in 4 days with simpler approach that was 5x faster. Users loved it.

Ship fast, iterate based on feedback, optimize what actually matters.

**4. Every Production Bug Is A Lesson**

My 7 major production bugs taught me more than any course:
- Database connection pooling (learned during live demo failure)
- Rate limiting (learned when bill hit $300 in one day)
- Input validation (learned when someone entered "99999" as distance)
- Error handling (learned when Maps API went down during peak usage)
- Race conditions (learned when two users were matched to same request)
- Cache invalidation (learned when users saw outdated venue info)
- Mobile responsiveness (learned when 82% of users were on phones)

**5. Community Beats Competition**

Other students building similar apps? I reached out, shared insights, collaborated. We all got better. Two of them helped me debug NeighborHelp before the competition.

Tech community is collaborative, not zero-sum.

## üîó Resources & Links

### My Projects
- **MeetSpot**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JasonRobertDestiny/MeetSpot) - Full source code, documentation
- **NeighborHelp**: Private (commercial potential) - But happy to discuss architecture

### Learning Resources That Actually Helped
- **API Design**: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
- **Prompt Engineering**: OpenAI Cookbook (free, constantly updated)
- **Geographic Algorithms**: Movable Type Scripts blog (Haversine, great circle calculations)
- **Trust Systems**: "Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments" by Kohavi et al.

### Tools I Actually Use
- **Development**: VS Code + Cursor AI (game-changer for boilerplate)
- **API Testing**: Postman + Custom Python scripts
- **Monitoring**: Simple logging to files (yes, really - kept costs down)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics + Custom event tracking
- **Deployment**: Railway (MeetSpot), Alipay Cloud (NeighborHelp)

## üéâ Final Thoughts

Building MeetSpot and NeighborHelp taught me something textbooks never could: **The gap between "technically correct" and "actually useful" is where real engineering happens.**

You can have perfect algorithms, clean architecture, and elegant code. But if users don't understand it, don't trust it, or can't afford to use it (API costs!), you've built nothing.

The awards were validation, but the real success was:
- The elderly user who told me NeighborHelp helped her get groceries when she couldn't carry them
- The study group that used MeetSpot 3 times a week and actually finished their project
- The user who submitted a detailed bug report because they cared enough to help improve the app

That's when you know you've built something that matters.

**To anyone reading this and thinking "I want to build an AI app":**

Do it. Start this weekend. Don't wait for the perfect idea or complete knowledge. Build something small, ship it to 5 friends, learn from their confusion and complaints, iterate, and repeat.

Your first version will be embarrassing. Mine were. That's good. It means you shipped.

I'll be building in public and sharing lessons on:
- üêô [GitHub](https://github.com/JasonRobertDestiny)
- üìù [Juejin (ÊéòÈáë)](https://juejin.cn/user/2637056597039172)
- üíª [CSDN Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/Soulrobert520)

Let's build something amazing. üöÄ
